<wp_sync_description>If you need a book to get started with JSF 2.0, there are a few options out there right now. The lack of online documentation makes these books necessary, but when you get your hands on one, fortunately there is usually some good information.

My overall rating for this book would be 6/10 stars. While there are comprehensive examples, it would have been nice if a single application were shown from start to finish, applying one critical concept to the application in each chapter; instead, the book uses a more piece-meal approach, where the chapters do not relate, and you must start over with a new example each time.

My secondary criticism of this book is that the author seems to have used out-dated information for several of the extension frameworks, and while the information is still good for the most part, there are some confusing sections - namely, the author did not submit the chapters on 3rd party extensions such as PrettyFaces, PrimeFaces, or RichFaces to the developers of those tools before publishing. As the creator of PrettyFaces, I would not recommend copying practices from the PrettyFaces examples shown in this book. While they are functional, they are not optimal.
