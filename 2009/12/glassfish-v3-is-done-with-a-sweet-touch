Now that's a nice touch - if only the issue numbers were links, which I added for your benefit :) But hey, cost benefit analysis says they did a great job.

Thank <b>you</b>, GlassFish Team!

So, GlassFish v3 is out the door, and I just got a nice little note from the dev-tracker on Java.net. This is only a fraction of the issues I've filed, but the rest are on the JSF-SPEC tracker, so they wouldn't show up here. Still, nice touch!
