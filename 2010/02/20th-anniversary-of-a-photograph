I sometimes get caught in the daily grind, worry about things that ... maybe aren't so important. There are bigger ideas out there, and I find a small sense of peace when I think about our lives in the context of something so vast and unknown.

Thank you, Carl Sagan, for such a clear and unburdened view of our world.</wp_sync_mt_text_more>
